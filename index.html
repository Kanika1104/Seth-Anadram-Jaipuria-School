          consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus
          with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and
          parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be
          provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices
          and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can
          eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
          Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

        <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
        <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 ">Implemented Online Attendance Management
          System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a
          student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps
          schools keep a record of the students’ absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this
          is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it
          can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the
          actual concepts of their curriculum’s subjects. As soon as you enter a student’s Enrollment Number or Name,
          details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are
          possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and
          powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span – just after the admin
          enters login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the
          educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave
          requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.</p>
